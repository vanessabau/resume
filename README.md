## About
Passionate, determined, and hard-working Web Developer with a professional career built from the ground up and across multiple disciplines. Successes in launching new businesses, expanding underrepresented access to performing arts, and creating innovative marketing stemmed from a creative, can-do attitude. With the belief that each day is an opportunity to be and do better, challenges are met with grit and optimism. Relationship-building, learning from industry professionals, time management, and organization are tools most utilized to work productively and efficiently alone or with others while being self-driven to reach goals.
